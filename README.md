Please download this folder and unzip it under the ./content folder

train.py script is for training a rawaudiovae, using a dataset folder. The dataset folder is a simple folder including a folder titled "audio", where the wav files should be. 

default.ini is a config file, and hyperparameter can be adjusted using the config file. 

The tutorial.ipynb uses a trained self-organizing map as well. The training of SOM can be found in another repo: https://github.com/ktatar/mlaudiosalad
